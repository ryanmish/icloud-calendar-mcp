"""Shared WebDAV plumbing for the CalDAV and CardDAV clients.

Both talk to the same account on the same provider with the same credentials,
so they hit the same walls: the same auth failures, the same account-wide rate
limiting, and the same principal-then-home discovery walk. Keeping that in one
place means a fix to any of it applies to both, rather than being fixed in one
protocol and quietly missing from the other.

Protocol-specific work -- what a collection is, what a resource contains, which
REPORTs exist -- stays in ``caldav.py`` and ``carddav.py``.
